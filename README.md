# Maginengine Audio Engine

# Welcome to Maginengine Audio!

## Introduction

**Maginengine Audio** started as an honours project in 2024. Its main focus was to understand how game audio engines are structured and designed to stay efficient and optimised. In game audio, we often talk about "staying within Budget", meaning: keeping CPU, Memory and Storage usage at a minimum so that more hardware intense programming can be processed without issues. This means that the audio programmers receive the smallest piece of the pie and so it is up to us to find more efficient and optimised ways to stay within budget. Although there is information available on generic audio programming, there seems to be a lack of information on how to approach game audio engine development, especially in the academic field. Therefore, I am dedicating this honours work and its future development in building Maginantion Audio, an educational tool for anyone interested in **Game Audio Engine architecture**.

## Few Things to note

- This project is still in development as of 26 Feb 2025
- Currently, I cannot address any issues, therefore please refer to the [Maginengine Audio wiki](https://github.com/JanHuss/MaginengineAudio/wiki) (which is also in development, please be patient while I set this up, thanks)
